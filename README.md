# README

This project is a set of notebooks experimenting with
having LLMs plan, code, and package a software
project.

## Setup

The notebooks are written with the expectation that you have
an API key from [openai](platform.openai.com) stored in a file
named `.venv` listed as: `OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_key_here>"`

The repository includes a script which will create a virtual
environment and install the requirments: `setup.sh`

To begin using the notebooks, you will need to activate
the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
